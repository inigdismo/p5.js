The film begins with Vishwas Rao (Shahid Kapoor) narrating his story. He was born in a small town, where his mother Savitri (Padmini Kolhapure) wanted him to become a police officer like his father. However, Vishwas had other plans and ran away to Mumbai to pursue his acting career. He joins a film institute and gets a chance to audition for a film directed by Mahesh Manjrekar.
 
On his way to the audition, he meets Kajal (Ileana D'Cruz), a social worker who thinks he is a real cop. She asks him to help her catch some goons who are harassing her friend's sister. Vishwas agrees and manages to impress Kajal with his bravery and charm. He also lies to his mother that he has joined the police force and sends her fake photos of him in uniform.
 
Meanwhile, a notorious gangster named Napoleon (Saurabh Shukla) escapes from prison and plans to kill Vishwas, who had unknowingly foiled his robbery attempt. He sends his henchmen to track him down and kill him. Vishwas also gets into trouble with the real police, who suspect him of being an impostor. He tries to balance his acting career, his love life and his family life, while avoiding the gangsters and the cops.
